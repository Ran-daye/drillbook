# User Defined Functions
This directory contains the source code for several examples of user defined functions which are discussed in detail in Learning Apache Drill. 

The functions are:
* **`is_valid_credit_card(<credit_card>)`**:  This UDF is used as an example in Chapter 11 to demonstrate a simple UDF.
